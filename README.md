# Employee Data Analysis and Visualization

This project provides a Python script for analyzing and visualizing employee data. The script uses Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and applies various statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Identify missing values.
  - Display descriptive statistics.
  
- **Data Analysis:**
  - Calculate metrics like mean age, unique values, and department-wise distribution.
  - Find highest paid employees, youngest employees, and more.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Create pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
  - Correlation heatmap to find relationships between numerical attributes.
  - Department-wise salary and age comparisons using bar charts.

- **Categorization:**
  - Add an `Experience` column to classify employees into `Senior` and `Junior`.

## Visualizations

1. **Pie Chart** - Department distribution.
2. **Histogram** - Age and salary distributions.
3. **Scatter Plot** - Relationship between age and salary.
4. **Box Plot** - Salary distribution by department.
5. **Bar Charts** - Average salary and age by department.
6. **Heatmap** - Correlation matrix for age and salary.

## Requirements

The script is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install them using:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Faizme/Pandas-Data-Analysis.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
3. Place your data file (data.csv) in the repository folder.

4. Run the script:
```
python data_analysis.py
```
5. Visualizations and insights will be displayed
